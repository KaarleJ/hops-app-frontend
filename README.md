# Hops-app frontend

The app is used to plan studies. The core functionality is a calendar which consists of 4 periods and 2 additional periods for summer studies. Courses can be added, edited and removed.

The app requires registering and logging in in order to use the calendar.

This app is running [here](https://hopsapp.fly.dev/)

The frontend of the app is crafted with Typescript, React and materialUI. E2E testing is performed with cypress.
