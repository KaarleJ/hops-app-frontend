# Hops-app frontend

This is the frontend for the HopsApp. The app is used to plan studies. The core functionality is a calendar which consists of 4 periods and 2 additional periods for summer studies. Courses can be added, edited and removed.

## Development

The frontend of the app is crafted with Typescript, React and materialUI. I used Jest and Cypress for unit and E2E tests.

The app is deployed on fly.io [here](https://hops.fly.dev/).
